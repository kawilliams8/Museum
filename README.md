# Museum

Museum is the final solo project of the FEE Program at the Turing School of Software & Design. This project was built in Vue.js, a completely new framework for the author, over a weekend. Testing occurred via Jest and the app is deployed to Heroku. This app displays artwork and information from the Harvard Art Museums API.

## Project setup
```
git clone https://github.com/kawilliams8/Museum.git
npm install
npm run serve
```

## Run the test suite
```
npm run test:unit
```

## Challenges
This project began with many difficulties installing Vue on two computers, eventually determined to be related to an out-of-date Bash PATH variable on each. Upon successful installation, I began research into Vue in general, looking for similarities with React's management of props and methods. The documentation and tutorials helped flesh out what was possible, but ultimately I ran out of time to execute the search functionality as hoped.
